              I'll be adding to my list of courses and sharing my thoughts on them throughout 
              college. The courses below are ones I've taken/are taking, and my technical classes
              are <b>bolded</b>. Classes I found particularly well-taught have a star (*) next to 
              them, and classes I found transformative have two stars (**).

              15-151 was my first class on mathematical proofs. It was very challenging but 
              interesting, and I enjoyed the new ways of thinking I was introduced to. 21-241 
              was very well organized. 15-122 was a good and thorough course on C programming, 
              but I didn't enjoy it as much as the others.

              15-251 was the most challenging and fascinating class this semester by far. Both Prof. Ada and 
              Prof. Saad are great, the class is very well structured, and there are lots of resources to 
              help you. 15-150, though it doesn't get any stars, was the class whose assignments I actually 
              enjoyed the most.

              15-213 was my main technical this semester, and I enjoyed it very much. I ended up going to 
              Prof. Kesden's lectures for 18-613 instead (same content). Prof. Kesden is a great lecturer, and 
              he puts great effort ito making sure we really understand the content and answering questions. This 
              semester was gen-ed heavy, since I finished up all my requirements. Genocide and Psychology
              were both thought-provoking classes that I would highly recommend

              15-440 was my first major systems course and an introduction to distributed systems. 
              It was a great entry point into systems thinking and highlighted how many core software 
              systems rely on distribution for scalability and reliability.

              I completed my core CS requirements with 15-451 this semester, a challenging but 
              rewarding course that pushed my understanding of algorithms and complexity. While 
              it built on familiar ideas such as dynamic programming and amortized analysis, it also 
              introduced new theoretical tools and ways of reasoning about performance. I also took Databases
               with Prof. Andy Pavlo, who was super cool. Over the semester, I implemented a full database management system, 
               directly implementing designs and concepts from class.
