              I'll be adding to my list of courses and sharing my thoughts on them throughout 
              college. The courses below are ones I've taken/are taking, and my technical classes
              are <b>bolded</b>. Classes I found particularly well-taught have a star (*) next to 
              them, and classes I found transformative have two stars (**).

              I've also included a <a href="#self_study" >section</a> with topics I'm self-studying, with links to the resources
              I'm using.

              15-151 was my first class on mathematical proofs. It was very challenging but 
              interesting, and I enjoyed the new ways of thinking I was introduced to. 21-241 
              was very well organized. 15-122 was a good and thorough course on C programming, 
              but I didn't enjoy it as much as the others.

              15-251 was the most challenging and fascinating class this semester by far. Both Prof. Ada and 
              Prof. Saad are great, the class is very well structured, and there are lots of resources to 
              help you. 15-150, though it doesn't get any stars, was the class whose assignments I actually 
              enjoyed the most. I even applied to TA the class, but was waitlisted.
