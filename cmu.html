              I'll be adding to my list of courses and sharing my thoughts on them throughout 
              college. The courses below are ones I've taken/are taking, and my technical classes
              are <b>bolded</b>. Classes I found particularly well-taught have a star (*) next to 
              them, and classes I found transformative have two stars (**).

              15-151 was my first class on mathematical proofs. It was very challenging but 
              interesting, and I enjoyed the new ways of thinking I was introduced to. Prof. John 
              Mackey is iconic for good reason, and I hope to take another class with him at CMU.

              <br></br>
              I thought 21-241 was very well organized. Prof. David Offner lectures well, and his class
              notes were clear and useful. I would definitely recommend taking his class. 
              <br></br>

              I quite enjoyed US Grand Strategy, although I wasn't able to put as much effort in the 
              class as I would've liked because I was constantly busy with other work. 15-122 was a 
              good and thorough course on C programming, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the others.

              <br>
              15-251 was the most challenging and fascinating class this semester by far. Both Prof. Ada and 
              Prof. Saad are great, the class is very well structured, and there are lots of resources to 
              help you. This class will require a good deal of outside study time â€” I feel like my understanding 
              of topics came mostly from poring over the class's textbook for hours, and lectures were simply the 
              cherry on top. 

              <br></br>
              21-266 gets a special mention because I took it with Prof. Clive Newstead, who (in my opinion) has got
              to be one of the best professors at CMU. Similar to my comments about 22-241 (Matrices), the class is 
              extremely organized and also challenging. Clive's homeworks and tests require a deep and thorough understanding 
              of the concepts and are always interesting. 

              <br></br> 
              15-150, though it doesn't get any stars, was probably the class whose assignments I actually 
              enjoyed the most. Functional programming was novel and elegant to me, so the homeworks were like 
              fun puzzles. I even applied to TA the class, but was waitlisted.
